### Experiment on digital editing made during a workshop at Ecal
This was a project made during a workshop at Ecal in Lausanne, centered around digital editing and algorithmic layouts. This main material used to build the book was a collection of all tweets present in my timeline during a 24h timespan. Each content (twitter bio, avatar, multimedia content, text) was separated and put on a different page, accompanied by a small glyph to represent their type, and linked together by page numbers. This makes the experience of reading this book like the one of reading a choose your own adventure book.

A small program was built to create the book easily so it could be done by anyone on with any Twitter account. It will probably be open-sourced in the future but you can ask me for the code if you're interested.
