###Cooperate First...
Blueprint is the first game I tried to do on my own. It's a couch co-op game, where you and one of your friends (or a stranger, I don't mind) play a couple of secret agents infiltrating an office tower. The game is in top-down 2D and you can only see what your character is seeing, so you have to play together to avoid being caught. For example, if one player is picking a lock, the other might want to check if no guards are coming their way.

#####You can't see what you character can't see.
Everything that players don't see is rendered as a blue floor-map.  
The levels are procedurally generated and if you die or are discovered, everything is going to be different when you start again. This is to prevent players from learning the layout of a level and always act by instinct.

####...And then betray your teammate
The players can also count on a variety of tools to aid them in their task. There are also guns but using them is highly discouraged because this is not an action game: they are noisy and attract guards, making everything more difficult. On each level, the players need to find the room containing the briefcase that they are supposed to steal.
Once they have it, it's every man for himself: only one agent is allowed to come back to base, and the treachery begins.

Blueprint is in a very early Alpha stage.
