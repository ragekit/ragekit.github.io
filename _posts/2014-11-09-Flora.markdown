###Contemplative flower generator
Flora is a small jam game that we made at the Zoomachine festival in november.
At first it was going to be a gardening simulator where you had to tend to various alien shaped flowers, but the lack of time transformed it into a contemplative experience where you watch flowers grow slowly from a simple stem to a gigantic tree.


Flower geometry is procedurally generated from scratch, with an homemade algorithm coded in a couple of hours during the jam.
