###Uncanny architecture outside of reality
These are visuals that were made during a workshop about 3D modeling, and my first ever use of a 3D modeling software. I tried to explore what architecture would look like if it wasn't constrained by physical reality, and if it existed in itself without use by mankind as a primary goal.

Without function, architectural elements are free to highlight their aesthetic and symbolic nature. Nevertheless, even if it is more freeform, this architecture is evolved from traditional architecture.
