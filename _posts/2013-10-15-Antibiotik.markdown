###Alternate reality 60s cabinet
Antibiotic is a weird arcade cabinet built for the Aix-en-Provence electronic fair "Eniarof". It was built as a 1960s artefact for a collection of alternate reality video games history exhibition. This is a collaboration game where each player sees what the other player is doing but not what they, themselves are doing, so they have to communicate, usually by yelling at each other.

They have at any point the choice to press a big red button and end the game, saving their score. If they lose, their score is erased and they get splashed by water coming out of the cabinet on their crotch, to shame them making people think they peed themselves.

#####Eniarof : a playful and spontaneous art exhibit
The game in itself is very simple: each player controls only one potentiometer they use to make the diameter of a circle change. If the player circle touches the outer of the inner ring, they lose health. If it touches the small dots on the game field, they get healed and earn points. This looks easy but it is in fact very hard and most of the time, players take too much risks and always end up with water all over themselves.
