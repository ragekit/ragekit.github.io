### Multiplayer reading
This project was made during a small workshop about the work of Jorge Luis Borges and it's link to hypertext narratives. I tried to build a way to read together in collaboration. A story, in this framework, is separated into different parts given to different people. Each time they read a passage, they gather and discuss about what they read to take decisions for their next reading session. Indeed: reading a part can have consequences on what others are reading, because it fixes what has been read into reality.


##### The story changes as it is read
For instance, if a person read some vital information about a suspect in a police novel, this information would be available to the main character in a further questioning. Paths emerge, are closed, get mixed up, depending on what is read.
