###Culture & Games
I'm Benjamin Gattet, a French multimedia **artist/Hacker** specialised in playful interactions, gamedesign, and exploring uncharted territories.

I'm freshly out of the the University of Art and Design of Geneva **HEAD** where I studied media design. Before that, I studied multimedia and digital design at **Gobelins, Paris**.    
I did websites and digital art before, and now I make games.

####Art & Technology
I doesn't really want to choose between being a **designer** or a being a **developer**, since I'm interested in what can spawn between art and technology, and learning new things all the time. I prefers to identify broadly as a **maker**.
