Benjamin Gattet is a French multimedia artist with an interest in video games, especially all the new things that can be done with them.

He's freshly out of the the University of Art and Design of Geneva (HEAD) where he studied media design. Before that, he also studied multimedia and digital design at Gobelins, the prestigious school of visual communication in Paris.

He created a lot of websites during his studies but realised that communication and web design wasn’t something he was really into, and decided that “games” as a broad concept would better describe what he wanted to do. He doesn't really want to choose between being a designer or a being a developer, and prefers to identify broadly as a maker.
Basically, he likes to be confronted to new things, and is an avid and fast learner.

"Artist" might have suited, but he always thought that you couldn't call yourself an artist, that it was a term that other people used to talk about you, or else it would be too arrogant.

(That might be a reason why Benjamin wrote this short description in the third person)
