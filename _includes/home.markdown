Hi ! I'm Benjamin Gattet, a French multimedia artist specialised in playful interactions and gamedesign, especially all the new things that can be done with them.

I'm freshly out of the the University of Art and Design of Geneva (HEAD) where I studied media design. Before that, I also studied multimedia and digital design at Gobelins, the prestigious school of visual communication in Paris.

I created a lot of websites during my studies but realised that communication and web design wasn’t something I was really into, and decided that “games” as a broad concept would better describe what I wanted to do.
I doesn't really want to choose between being a designer or a being a developer,since I'm interested in what can spawn between art and technology, and so, prefers to identify broadly as a maker.

Basically, I likes to be confronted to new things, and am an avid and fast learner.

If you're interested in those kind of things you can find my CV [Here]({{ "assets/cv.pdf" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

If you want to see older projects of mine, have a look at the portfolios I sents to [Gobelins]({{ "assets/gobelins2010.pdf" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) and [Head]({{ "assets/head2012.pdf" | prepend: site.baseurl }})
