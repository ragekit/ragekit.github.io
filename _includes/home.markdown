Welcome. I'm Benjamin Gattet, a French multimedia **artist/Hacker** specialized in playful interactions, gamedesign, and exploring uncharted territories.

I'm freshly out of the the University of Art and Design of Geneva **HEAD** where I studied media design. Before that, I studied multimedia and digital design at **Gobelins, Paris**.    
I did websites and digital art before, and now I make games.

I don't really want to choose between being a designer or a being a developer, since I'm interested in what can spawn between art and technology, and learning new things all the time. I prefer to identify as a **maker**.

You can find my CV [Here]({{ "/assets/cv.pdf" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
If you want to see older projects of mine, have a look at the portfolios I sent to [Gobelins]({{ "/assets/gobelins2010.pdf" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) and [Head]({{ "/assets/head2012.pdf" | prepend: site.baseurl }})
