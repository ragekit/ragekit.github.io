Benjamin Gattet is an **interdisciplinary Artist/Designer/Hacker** specialized in playful interactions, game design, and exploring uncharted territories.

His work revolves around **atypical experiences**, new forms of narration (wordless, environmental, purely diegetic or systemic), procedurality and the phenomenology of play.

He is doing a ***PhD in Game Design and Game Criticism***.

He holds a ***MA in Media Design*** from the ***University of Geneva HEAD***, where his final dissertation was about the new kind in narration found in videogames. To explore the ideas of his thesis, he made a small videogame : Within, which can be found on his itch.io page.

Before that he studied **multimedia and digital design at Gobelins, Paris**.

Benjamin is interested in what can spawn **between art and technology**, that’s why he doesn’t want to clearly identify either as a designer or as a developer, but rather as a **maker**.
